          <h2>Schedule</h2>

          <div class="subsection">
            <h3>Rank Check</h3>
            <h4>July 9<sup>th</sup> (7pm CST)</h4>

            <p>No games will be played on this day.</p>

            <p>Players will be ranked 1-11 based on their Season 4 competitive 1v1 ranks as of July 9<sup>th</sup> @ 7pm CST (one week prior to tourney). If your rank changes after the rank check, it will <strong>not</strong> be factored in. Rankings will be locked in for the week leading up to the tourney.</p>

            <p>
              <ul>
                <li><span class="medium">Ranks 1-6</span>: Auto-qualify for bracket spot</li>
                <li><span class="medium">Ranks 7-11</span>: Play in wildcard playoff to fight for the last 2 bracket spots</li>
              </ul>
            </p>

            <p>Each player will need to have a minimum of 50 competitive 1v1 games played in Season 4, and also must have played at least two competitive 1v1 games in the 30 days preceding July 9<sup>th</sup>. Players who do not meet these requirements will be seeded <strong>after</strong> all of the players who have met the requirements.</p>

            <p>Rank checks will be done via <a href="https://rocketleague.tracker.network">Rocket League Tracker</a> based on MMR rating (see screenshot below).</p>

            <img src="images/rank-check.png" class="rank-check-image" alt="bval is a scrub" />

            <p><i>Unfortunately, the Rocket League in-game leaderboard does not always accurately reflect precise MMR rating so we will <strong>not</strong> be using it.</i></p>
          </div>

          <div class="subsection">
            <h3>Day 1: Wildcard Weekend</h3>
            <h4>July 16 (7-9pm CST)</h4>

            <p>Players ranked 7-11 will face off against each other in a 5-man round robin to determine the final two players to qualify for the bracket.</p>
            <p>Players will play each other once for a total of 4 games each, and the two players with the best records (tiebreakers if necessary) will advance to bracket play and will be seeded according to their round robin results.</p>

          </div>

          <div class="subsection">

            <h3>Days 2-4: Bracket Play</h3>
            <h4>July 19, 20, 24 (7-9pm CST)</h4>

            <p>Players who qualify for bracket play will face off in an 8-man double-elimination bracket (see below).</p>

            <img src="images/bracket.gif" class="bracket-image" alt="kevin will choke" />

            <p>Players 1-6 will be seeded in order of their ranks done at rank check time. Players 7-8 will be seeded based on their round robin results.</p>

            <p>The first three days of bracket play will take place with 3-4 best-of-3 series played on each night. Initial matchups will be determined by seeding (1v8, 2v7, etc), and players will <strong>not</strong> be reseeded in future rounds.</p>

            <p>Winners will advance along in the winners bracket, and losers will drop to the losers bracket but will not be eliminated until they suffer another series loss.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="subsection">
            <h3>Day 5: Final Four</h3>
            <h4>July 30 (3-7pm, 7:30-9pm if necessary)</h4>

            <p>The final day of the tournament will kick off with two best-of-5 series played. Following these series, there will be two players remaining who will advance to a best-of-7 championship series for the trophy.</p>

            <p>If the loser of this series is the player in the winners bracket (has no series losses prior to championship), then a final best-of-7 series will be played (preceded by a short break) to determine the winner of the tournament.</p>

              <h3>Round robin tiebreakers</h3>

              <p>In the event that 2 or more players finish with the same round robin record, a series of tiebreakers will be used to determine their round robin ranking.</p>

            <h2>Communication</h2>

            <p>Pre-tournament communication will be done via text message. Please don't use the group text for questions and comments &mdash; just message me (Zak) directly, so we don't flood people's inbox.</p>

            <p>During the tournament, communication will be done via <a href="https://discordapp.com/">Discord</a>. I will send an invite to our private Discord room one week prior to the tournament. Please be available on Discord during your games so in case anything goes wrong we can quickly resolve it.</p>
